# Multi-Agent Example

This directory contains an example of hand-crafted agents to convert a
multi-agent task into a single-agent task. Using hand-crafted agent can be
useful for running the demo script on a multi-agent task. In this particular
example, the demo script can be played by navigating to
[`../oog_demos`](../oog_demos) and running
```bash
$ python3 run_demo.py --config='multi_agent_example.configs.cleanup'
```
